Behaviour Driven Development - First Test Case
0. Integration tests, known as request specs in the context of RSpec, allow us to simulate the actions of a user interacting with our application using a web browser.
1. Capybara provides natural-language syntax
2. rails generate integration_test static_pages
3. Understand and change generated code in static_pages_spec.rb (testing route)
describe "StaticPages" do
  describe "GET /static_pages/home" do
    it "should work" do
      get static_pages_home_path
      response.status.should be(200)
    end
  end
end
4. Run test case - bundle exec rspec spec/requests/static_pages_spec.rb
5. Write another test case
describe "Home page" do
  it "should have the content 'Training App'" do
    visit '/static_pages/home'
    page.should have_content('Training App')
  end
end
6. visit is method and page is instance variable provided by capybara
7. Change home.html.erb
<h1>Training App</h1>
<p>
  This is the home page for the
  <a href="http://github.com/ezzie">Ruby on Rails Training</a>
  by Ezzie Infosystems.
</p>
8. bundle exec rspec spec/requests/static_pages_spec.rb
9. Add new test case as below
  describe "Help page" do
    it "should have the content 'Help'" do
      visit '/static_pages/help'
      page.should have_content('Help')
    end
  end
10. Run test that will fail - bundle exec rspec spec/requests/static_pages_spec.rb
11. Update help.html.erb
<h1>Help</h1>
<p>
  Get help on the Ruby on Rails Training at the
  <a href="http://github.com/ezzie">Rails Training help page</a>
</p>
12. Run test again - bundle exec rspec spec/requests/static_pages_spec.rb - now they will pass

TEST FIRST DEVELOPMENT - Adding a page
0. RGR - Red, Green, Refractor cycle
1. Add new test case for about
  describe "About page" do
    it "should have the content 'About Us'" do
      visit '/static_pages/about'
      page.should have_content('About Us')
    end
  end
2. bundle exec rspec spec/requests/static_pages_spec.rb - look at routing error in logs
3. Add this line to routes.rb file - get "static_pages/about"
4. bundle exec rspec spec/requests/static_pages_spec.rb - look at StaticPagesController error in logs
5. Add below action in StaticPagesController
def help
end
6. bundle exec rspec spec/requests/static_pages_spec.rb - look at Missing template static_pages/about error in logs
7. Add new file called about.html.erb with following contents
<h1>About Us</h1>
<p>
  The <a href="http://github.com/ezzie">Ruby on Rails Training</a>
  is provided by <a href="http://www.ezzie.in">Ezzie Infosystems</a> to teach web development
</p>
8. bundle exec rspec spec/requests/static_pages_spec.rb - Now all tests will be passes
